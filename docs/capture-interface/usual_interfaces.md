# Usual Interfaces in Practice
This section enumerates the interfaces that exist in typical side-channel and fault analysis setups. 

1.	**User Computer ↔️ Workstation**

    a.	**Purpose:** the User Computer provides a human interface to the measurement setup, including control of the workstation, and visualization and analysis of measurement data.

    b.	**Data:** session control, configuration of workstation, transfer of formatted payloads (target firmware, target bitstream, target test vectors, measured data). 

    c.	**Features:** bandwidth, latency, real-time response.

    d.	**Logical layer:** API for Session Control, API for Payload Formatting.

    e.	**Physical layer:** digital Data Transfer.

    f.	**Example:** USB, Ethernet.

2.	**Workstation ↔️ Control Board**

    a.	**Purpose:** allows sending/receiving information (e.g., configuration, state, plaintexts, ciphertexts, number of repetitions) to the Target, executing one or multiple operations with/without repeatedly sending all the inputs from the Workstation to the Target each time. In some setups, the Control Board may not be present as the Workstation is directly connected to the Target. In some instances, the communication of inputs and/or outputs can be handled for efficiency reasons by the Communication (see Interface 14) instead of the Control Board. In other cases, the Control Board can be merged with the Target.

    b.	**Data:** test vectors (e.g., inputs, expected outputs) and commands (e.g., execute a specific operation) from the Workstation to the Control Board, which are forwarded, as they are or in a different form, to the Target. The control board responds to the commands from the workstation, which may include status and outputs received by the control board from the target.

    c.	**Features:** bandwidth, latency, signaling, and communication protocols.
