title: Open-source Capture Interface

# Open-source Capture Interface
Table 1 lists some of the open-source frameworks. As can be seen, a few frameworks offer publicly available capture interfaces. The lack of such interfaces not only affects the reproducibility of the results in SCA but also negatively impacts certification laboratories and standardization bodies that assess attack costs corresponding to side-channel and fault analysis.
