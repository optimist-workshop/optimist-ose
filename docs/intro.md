# Introduction
Welcome to the Optimist Hour! This is a friendly and open space for researchers, industry professionals, and community members to come together and discuss important challenges related to standard APIs and interoperability for trace data formats. We focus particularly on side-channel data and other real-time measurements of implementation security.

These meetings, facilitated by a member of the Optimist Team, offer a structured forum designed to encourage participants to exchange insights, critically evaluate new proposals, and engage in scholarly debate. We prioritize the inclusion of diverse perspectives, fostering a rigorous academic environment that advances collective understanding, innovation, and progress.

After each Optimist Hour session, the main points and next steps from our discussions are carefully summarized and shared openly within the Optimist Open Source Ecosystem (Optimist OSE). This keeps our process transparent, encourages ongoing collaboration, and helps us continuously improve how we manage secure and interoperable data.

Join us at Optimist Hourâ€”we'd love to hear your ideas and work together to shape the future of implementation security.
