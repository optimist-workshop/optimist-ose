# OPTIMIST HOUR

The Optimist Hour meetings will be a place where citizens will be able
to discuss, share, and debate ideas to address standard APIs and
interoperability issues for trace data formats of side-channel data
and other real-time measurements of implementation security. These
meetings will be chaired by a member of the Optimist Team and the
primary discussion points will be compiled and shared within the
Optimist OSE.

## Next Meeting: <span style="color:#011673;font-weight:bold;"> Thursday, March 6, at 3 PM GMT</span>

## OPTIMIST Meeting Series

The optimist hour meetings are scheduled as follows.

* October 24, 11 AM EST (3 PM GMT) – [Topic: File Format for Traces](https://optimist-ose.org/optimist-hour-24)
* January 23, 10 AM EST (3 PM GMT) – Topic: Capture Interface for Side-channel Leakage
* April 25, 11 AM EST (3 PM GMT) – Topic: Firmware Interface for Target Control

These meetings will address three main points brought up during the
previous Optimist Hour meeting, including, trace format requirements,
keywords, and common APIs. Over the course of three meeting the goal
will be to produce a document that compiles requirements, common
keywords and potential API solutions for trace data formats.
