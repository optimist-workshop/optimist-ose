# Acceleration of AI for Implementation Security Testing

**OPTIMIST**  (Open Tools, Interfaces, and Metrics for Implementation Security Testing) is an open-source initiative to improve standardization and interoperability in security testing for cryptographic implementations. AI acceleration platforms and AI algorithms play a role of growing importance in implementation security testing. This session will bring together researchers, industry professionals, and government stakeholders to discuss challenges, methodologies, and best practices in acceleration of AI for Implementation Security Testing.

**Date & Time:** Thursday, 17 April, 2025 at 11AM EDT (3PM GMT)  
**Zoom Link:** [Join Meeting](https://wpi.zoom.us/j/91072710391)

#### 11:00-11:05 AM — Introduction & Overview

#### 11:05-11:15 AM — Side Channel and Fault Attack Testing of Cryptosystems in the view of Dr AI
**Debdeep Mukhopadhyay**, Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur  
**Abstract:** TBA

#### 11:15-11:25 AM — Machine Learning-based Side-channel Analysis and Evaluation
**Stjepan Picek**, Associate Professor, Radboud University  
**Abstract:** Machine learning (and more recently, deep learning) showed significant potential for side-channel analysis (SCA). Indeed, such techniques can break protected targets while requiring minimal expert knowledge. However, different setups (targets, ciphers, countermeasures, acquisition setups, etc.) may easily necessitate different machine learning architectures or settings. In this talk, we will briefly discuss (potential) advantages of standard architectures and libraries and how those could further push state-of-the-art machine learning-based SCA.

#### 11:25-11:35 AM — AI-accelerated Implementation Testing: Research vs Practice
**Jakub Breier**, Senior Cyber Security Manager, TTControl GmbH  
**Abstract:** TBA

#### 11:35-11:45 AM — Q&A

#### 11:45 AM – 12:00 PM — Interactive Discussion
A collaborative discussion and brainstorming in an interactive group format.
