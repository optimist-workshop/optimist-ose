**Conclusion:** Plenty of software libraries do exist.


## HW implementations lists

- **Test Vectors:** NIST KAT files can be used.  If separate test vectors are needed for component-level testing, they can be obtained from reference software implementations.  An important issue is to test for negative cases (e.g., rejections in sampling and decapsulation errors)
ACVP JSON test vector files for FIPS 203,204,205 (and all other NIST algorithms, like AES, SHA3) from https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP-Server/tree/master/gen-val/json-files
For an example of usage, see Python code at: https://github.com/mjosaarinen/py-acvp-pqc
Test-vector compliant Python code can also be useful for creating unit tests (e.g. SystemVerilog testbenches etc) for hardware implementations (e.g. testing NTT or rejection sampling components)

**Conclusion:** There are significant resources out there.  But they are scattered and buried.  A structured, central index with useful resources can help accelerate the learning curve.  A textbook dedicated to the implementation security testing of PQC with hands-on components is needed.
