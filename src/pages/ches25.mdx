# OPTIMIST Workshop '25
## September 14, 2025 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and  reproducible research in implementation security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts  themselves, but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software tools that enable  reproducibility and quality in implementation security testing.

<p>Talks are 15 min in length, and are presented from the podium with slides, followed by a brief Q&A. The program committee will select among proposed talks based on fit for OPTIMIST and whether it will stimulate discussion and interest among the audience of hardware security practitioners, academics, and students. OPTIMIST welcomes talks based on both archival and non-archival work.</p>
