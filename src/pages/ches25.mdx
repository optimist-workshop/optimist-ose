# OPTIMIST Workshop '25
## September 14, 2025 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

The OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and  reproducible research in implementation security. The OPTIMIST emphasis is not on the artifacts  themselves, but on the interfaces, components, libraries, hardware, and software tools that enable  reproducibility and quality in implementation security testing. 

The field of open source as applied to implementation security testing is still in full expansion. It is  therefore vital to have a forum that enables open conversation. From the communityâ€™s perspective,  there is a need to compare different initiatives and to explore the viability of standard techniques and  metrics to express implementation security. Moreover, standard interfaces in the components are required, which complement the implementation security assessment ecosystem. Indeed, leaving  such a discussion as a byproduct of papers â€” reviewed solely in the formal, peer-review format â€”  imposes a risk of limiting the ideas to a set of scattered publications without ever having the chance  of an apples-to-apples comparison. In addition, the user community of open interfaces and metrics  for implementation security testing must include members at testing labs and research labs who are  not used to publishing on a regular basis. 

The organizers intend to develop a full-day program that evaluates the topic of open interfaces in  implementation security testing from multiple angles, including short, contributed talks of  participants; a panel by the developers, users, and stakeholders of the open-source ecosystem; and  a plenary talk from one recent success story in this area (examples could include ASCAD,  ChipWhisperer, ROSITA++, MetriSCA, etc.).

<h2>ðŸ“¢ Call for Contributions</h2>
<p>As the OPTIMIST workshop is a forum to present and discuss new efforts that enable open and reproducible research in implementation security, the organizers and program committee invite submissions of proposals for talks. </p> 

Topics of interest for OPTIMIST include:

<ul>
<li>Datasets pertaining to Side-channel Analysis and Fault Analysis</li>
<li>Standard Libraries for Metrics in Implementation Security</li>
<li>Standard Application Programming Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation</li>
<li>Standard Hardware Interfaces for Security Measurement Instrumentation</li>
<li>Standard Firmware Libraries and Hardware Targets for Security Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Talks are 15 min in length, and are presented from the podium with slides, followed by a brief Q&A. The program committee will select among proposed talks based on fit for OPTIMIST and whether it will stimulate discussion and interest among the audience of hardware security practitioners, academics, and students. OPTIMIST welcomes talks based on both archival and non-archival work.</p>

<p>Each submission should be nonanonymous. A talk abstract must be at most 1 page, including a title, name of contributors and presenter(s), and a work description that can include figures and references. The authors are encouraged to refer to their paper published elsewhere before (if any), serving as the basis for the talk.</p>
